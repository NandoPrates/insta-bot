# insta-bot
An Insagram bot made with Python and independant from the Instagram API.

The bot has an unique user-friendly class (src/instabot.py) which carry the main instagram actions. The class is documented so I suggest you to type `help(InstaBot)`. 

After you downloaded the repository you would have to install the modules the bot needs :
`pip install -r requierements.txt`

HELP IN THE BOT DEVELOPPEMENT IS WELCOMED 
(and if someone can correct the english language mistakes ? ^^)
